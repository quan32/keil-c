### Enabling and Disabling Interrupts
Register : IE (Interrupt Enable)
Detail   :
Symbol	Bit Number	Description
EA		7	Enable/disable all interrupts. If this bit is cleared all interrupts are disabled. If it is set each interrupt source is individually enabled or disabled by setting or clearing the appropriate enable bit, as detailed below.
--		6	 
--		5	 
ES		4	Enable/disable serial port interrupts (set to enable, clear to disable).
ET1		3	Enable/disable timer 1 overflow interrupt (set to enable, clear to disable).
EX1		2	Enable/disable external 1 interrupt (set to enable, clear to disable).
ET0		1	Enable/disable timer 0 overflow interrupt (set to enable, clear to disable).
EX0		0	Enable/disable external 0 interrupt (set to enable, clear to disable).

### Interrupt Priority
Polling Sequence:
	External 0 -> Timer 0 Overflow -> External 1 -> Timer 1 Overflow -> the Serial Port.
Register  : IP
Detail    :
Symbol	Bit Number	Description
--		7	 
--		6	 
--		5	 
PS		4	Serial port interrupt priority level.
PT1		3	Timer 1 interrupt priority level.
PX1		2	External interrupt 1 priority level.
PT0		1	Timer 0 interrupt priority level.
PX0		0	External interrupt 0 priority level.

### Timer Overflow (view Timer)

### External Interrupts
Defination:
	External interrupts occur as a result of a low-level or negative edge on the INT0-bar or INT1-bar pins on the 8051 
	(INT0-bar is at P3.2 while INT1-bar is at P3.3).

Timer Control Register (TCON)
Bit	Symbol	Bit Address	Description
7	TF1		8FH		Timer 1 overflow flag; set by hardware upon overflow, cleared by software.
6	TR1		8EH		Timer 1 run-control bit; manipulated by software - setting starts timer 1, resetting stops timer 1.
5	TF0		8DH		Timer 0 overflow flag; set by hardware upon overflow, cleared by software.
4	TR0		8CH		Timer 0 run-control bit; manipulated by software - setting starts timer 0, resetting stops timer 0.
[above: for timer]
3	IE1		8BH		Interrupt External 1: This bit is set by the processor when there is an interrupt at INT1
										  This bit is cleared by the processor when there is a jump to ISR of INT1
2	IT1		8AH		Interrupt Type 1 	: Set this bit for an interrupt generated by a low level signal at INT1
										  Clear this bit for an interrupt genarated by a falling adge signal at INT1
1	IE0		89H		Interrupt External 1: This bit is set by the processor when there is an interrupt at INT10
										  This bit is cleared by the processor when there is a jump to ISR of INT0
0	IT0		88H 	Interrupt Type 1 	: Set this bit for an interrupt generated by a low level signal at INT0
										  Clear this bit for an interrupt genarated by a falling adge signal at INT0
