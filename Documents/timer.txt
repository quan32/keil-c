### Timer Mode Register
Register  : TMOD
Detail    :
Bit	Name	Timer	Description
7	Gate	1	Gate bit; when set, timer only runs while INT-bar is high. This bit is used in conjunction with interrupts and will be dealt with later.
6	C/T-bar	1	Counter/timer select bit; when set timer is an event counter, when cleared timer is an interval timer.
5	M1		1	Mode bit 1
4	M0		1	Mode bit 0
3	Gate	0	Gate bit; when set, timer only runs while INT-bar is high.
2	C/T-bar	0	Counter/timer select bit; when set timer is an event counter, when cleared timer is an interval timer.
1	M1		0	Mode bit 1
0	M0		0	Mode bit 0

## Mode
M1	M0	Mode	Description
0	0	0	13-bit timer mode (this mode exists simply to keep the 8051 backwards compatible with its predecessor, the 8048, which had a 13-bit timer) - we will not be using mode 0.
0	1	1	16-bit timer mode
1	0	2	8-bit auto-reload mode
1	1	3	Split timer mode - this mode will be dealt with at a later stage
Mode 1 - 16-bit mode
The high byte (THx) is cascaded with the low byte (TLx) to produce a 16-bit timer. This timer counts from 0000H to FFFFH - it has 216 (65,536) states. An overflow occurs during the FFFFH to 0000H transition, setting the overflow flag (to be dealt with shortly).
 	 
Mode 2- 8-bit auto-reload mode
The timer low byte (TLx) operates as an 8-bit timer (counting to FFH) while the high byte holds a reload value. When the timer overflows from FFH, rather than starting again from 00H, the value in THx is loaded into TLx and the count continues from there.

### Timer Control Register (TCON)
Bit	Symbol	Bit Address	Description
7	TF1		8FH		Timer 1 overflow flag; set by hardware upon overflow, cleared by software.
6	TR1		8EH		Timer 1 run-control bit; manipulated by software - setting starts timer 1, resetting stops timer 1.
5	TF0		8DH		Timer 0 overflow flag; set by hardware upon overflow, cleared by software.
4	TR0		8CH		Timer 0 run-control bit; manipulated by software - setting starts timer 0, resetting stops timer 0.
[below: for external interrupts]
3	IE1		8BH		The bottom four bits of TCON are used in conjunction with interrupts - they will be dealt with at a later stage.
2	IT1		8AH
1	IE0		89H
0	IT0		88H

### Examples
Ex1		: timer0 as event counter, timer1 as interval timer
Solve	:
		bit		value	note
Timer1	7	0	gate (set when using interrupts, reset otherwise)
		6	0	C/T-bar (0 because timer 1 is to be an interval timer)
		5	0	mode bits (01 for mode 1 - 16-bit)
		4	1
Timer0	3	0	gate (set when using interrupts, reset otherwise)
		2	1	C/T-bar (1 because timer 0 is to be an event counter)
		1	1	mode bits (10 for mode 2 - 8-bit auto-reload)
		0	0

timer0 as event counter(mode 2 - 8-bit auto-reload  && interrupt disable) :
TMOD = 0x06
TH0  = 
TL0  = 
TR0  = 1

timer1 as interval timer (mode 1 - 16-bit && interrupt enable)
TMOD = 0x90
TH1  = 
TL1  = 
TR1  = 1
